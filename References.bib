abstract = {Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate whether people with a pre-existing mental health disorder (MHD) benefit from rehabilitation following a spinal cord injury (SCI) and how their outcomes differ from those without a pre-existing MHD. Methods: Rehabilitation outcomes of a cohort of patients with pre-existing MHD discharged from the London SCI Centre over a 6-year period were investigated. A retrospective matched case-control study design was used to compare the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III between those with an SCI and pre-existing MHD and those without and both compared with published expected outcomes. Results: The study found that, overall, those with MHD do benefit from SCI rehabilitation and that their outcomes do not significantly differ from those without MHD. Furthermore, the outcomes were favourable when compared with published expected outcomes. Conclusion: Having a pre-existing MHD does not preclude patients with an SCI from benefiting from rehabilitation. These findings are an important basis on which to ensure equal access to rehabilitation for patients with a pre-existing MHD.},

@article{Sekhon2001,
abstract = {Spinal cord injury occurs through various countries throughout the world with an annual incidence of 15 to 40 cases per million, with the causes of these injuries ranging from motor vehicle accidents and community violence to recreational activities and workplace-related injuries. Survival has improved along with a greater appreciation of patterns of presentation, survival, and complications. Despite much work having been done, the only treatment to date known to ameliorate neurologic dysfunction that occurs at or below the level of neurologic injury has been intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. Much research over the past 30 to 40 years has focused on elucidating the mechanisms of spinal cord injury, with the complex pathophysiologic processes slowly being unraveled. With a greater understanding of both primary and secondary mechanisms of injury, the roles of calcium, free radicals, sodium, excitatory amino acids, vascular mediators, and apoptosis have been elucidated. This review examines the epidemiology, demographics, and pathophysiology of acute spinal cord injury.},

abstract = {Study design: Review supplemented by inception cohort. Objectives: To review trends in the incidence, prevalence, demographic characteristics, etiology, injury severity and selected treatment outcomes of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: International review and US model systems cohort.Methods:An extensive literature review was conducted to identify all relevant studies of descriptive epidemiology of traumatic SCI. This review was supplemented by analyses of trends in US SCI epidemiology that are reflected in the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center and Shriners Hospital Spinal Cord Injury databases. Results: Incidence and prevalence of traumatic SCI in the United States are higher than in the rest of the world. Average age at injury is increasing in accordance with an aging general population at risk. The proportion of cervical injuries is increasing, whereas the proportion of neurologically complete injuries is decreasing. Injuries due to falls are increasing. Recent gains in general population life expectancy are not reflected in the SCI population. Treatment outcomes are changing as a result of increasing age and changes in US health care delivery. Conclusion: Within the prevalent population, the percentage of elderly persons will not increase meaningfully until the high mortality rates observed among older persons significantly improve. Those who reach older ages will typically have incomplete and/or lower level injuries, and will have relatively high degrees of independence and overall good health. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Spinal Cord Society.
